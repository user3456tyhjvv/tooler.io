# APIMatic OAuth Adapters Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides pluggable adapters for OAuth 2.0 authentication schemes.

The exported functionality includes:

* **Request Authentication Provider**: Creates pluggable authentication interceptors for API requests, managing token usage, automatic token refresh, and setting authentication headers.
* **Token Validity Check**: Checks whether the provided OAuth token is defined.
* **Token Expiration Validation**: Determines whether the provided OAuth token is expired, with optional clock skew adjustment.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
