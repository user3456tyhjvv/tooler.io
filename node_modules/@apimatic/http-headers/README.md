# APIMatic HTTP Headers Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides utilities for managing HTTP headers with case-insensitive handling and validation.

The exported functionality includes:

* **Case-Insensitive Header Management**: Set, replace, and retrieve headers without case sensitivity.
* **Conditional Header Addition**: Adds headers only if they are not already set.
* **Header Name Lookup**: Identifies the actual header name in a map regardless of casing differences.
* **Headers Merging**: Merges multiple header maps, preserving original casing while updating values as needed.
* **Headers Validation**: Validates header names to ensure compliance with HTTP standards.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
