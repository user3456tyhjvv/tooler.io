# APIMatic Core Interfaces Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides essential type definitions and interfaces that define how SDK components communicate.

The exported types and interfaces include:

* **API Response**: Standardized response structures for API calls.
* **Authentication**: Interfaces defining authentication adapters and interceptors.
* **HTTP Context and Client**: Core abstractions for HTTP request/response handling and client implementations.
* **Interceptor**: Definitions for HTTP interceptors enabling request/response transformation and middleware behavior.
* **Retry Configuration**: Types and interfaces for configuring retry logic in network calls.
* **Logging**: Contracts for logging within HTTP clients and SDK operations.
* **Paged Async Iterables**: Type support for async iteration over paged API results.
* **Signature Verification**: Interfaces and types for verifying HTTP request signatures.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
