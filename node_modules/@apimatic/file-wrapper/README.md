# APIMatic File Wrapper Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides utilities for wrapping files with metadata for HTTP requests.

The exported classes and functions include:

* **File Wrapper Class**: Encapsulates a file (Blob or stream) along with optional metadata such as MIME type, filename, and custom headers for multipart HTTP requests.
* **Type Guard for File Wrapper**: Identifies if a given value is an instance of the File Wrapper class.
* **Deep Cloning**: Creates a deep copy of a File Wrapper instance, including its metadata and headers.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
