# APIMatic Convert-to-Stream Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides utility functions to convert data between strings, Node.js streams, and browser Blob objects. It supports both Node.js and browser environments with automatic platform-specific handling.

The exported functionality includes:

* **Cross-Platform Stream Conversion**: Automatically detects the runtime environment to convert data between Node.js streams and browser Blob objects.
* **Bidirectional Data Conversion**: Enables conversion between strings, streams, and blobs for flexible and seamless data handling.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
