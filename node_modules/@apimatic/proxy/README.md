# APIMatic Proxy Library for JavaScript SDKs

This package provides utilities to create HTTP and HTTPS proxy agents based on configuration, with conditional behavior for both Node.js and browser environments.

The exported functionality includes:

* **Proxy Agent**: Generates HTTP and HTTPS proxy agents using the provided proxy settings. In browser environments, returns undefined with a warning since proxy agents are not supported.
* **Proxy Settings Interface**: Defines the proxy configuration, including a required address and optional port and authentication credentials.

This library is used by JavaScript SDKs generated by the [APIMatic Code Generator](http://www.apimatic.io). For details on supported platforms and build artifacts, see the [Build and Usage Section](https://github.com/apimatic/apimatic-js-runtime?tab=readme-ov-file#builds-and-usage).
